> The original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. This dataset is converted for outlier detection as digit-zero class is considered as inliers, while 700 images are sampled from digit-six class as the outliers. In addition, 100 features are randomly selected from 784 total features.
