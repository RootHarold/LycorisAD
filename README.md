**LycorisAD** is an elegant outlier detection algorithm framework based on *AutoEncoder*.

The neural network is built with [LycorisNet](https://github.com/RootHarold/Lycoris), and the threshold of reconstruction error is calculated by genetic algorithm (based on [deap](https://github.com/DEAP/deap)).

# Features
* Lightweight and elegant.
* Need not to manually design the structure of the autoencoder.
* Provide minimalist APIs to make development more efficient.

# Installation
```
pip install LycorisAD
```
